# Auto Cleric
Automatically buy cleric HP buff when you take damage.

### Chat commands:
* **!cleric** - Toggles the module off/on (On by default)
* **!cleric.hp** - Manually buy HP from cleric

### Notes:
* You must talk to a cleric first, before module can automate.
* Only works if you are within range of the cleric
* Good for dueling or if you need a dummy to test stuff on.
